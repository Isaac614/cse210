# cse210-student-template
This is the starter code for Isaac Moore in CSE 210.

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged as follows:

* `sandbox` - An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like.
* `csharp-prep` - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments.
* `prepare` - Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities.
* `prove` - Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects.
* `final` - Starter projects for final project.

In develop 03 I use a shorthand way to create getters for some of the fields in Reference. What this does is create a special type method that when called will return the value in the corresponding field.
